## Project Overview
This is an open-source AI Agent project called OpenManus. It leverages LLM capabilities to complete complex task planning and execution. The project is written in Python and runs on Python 3.12 version.

## Background Information
I want to run this project in the cloud and add a web interface, packaging it as a product that anyone can use directly in a browser. I hope to run the code it produces in an isolated environment and deploy the completed code directly to the cloud, where users can access it directly.

## General Development Principles
- DRY（Don't Repeat Yourself）
- SOLID
- KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
- YAGNI (You Ain't Gonna Need It)
- POLA (Principle of Least Astonishment)
- LoD (Law of Demeter)
- SoC (Separation of Concerns)
- High Cohesion, Loose Coupling
