# Git Specification
## Commit Guidelines
Git commit message format: [type]: [description]. For example: docs: update README.
The following are the enumerated values for type:
- feat: Add new feature
- fix: Fix bug
- docs: Documentation and comments
- style: Code format (changes that do not affect code execution)
- refactor: Refactoring, optimization (neither adding new features nor fixing bugs)
- perf: Performance optimization
- test: Add tests
- chore: Changes to build process or auxiliary tools
- revert: Rollback
- build: Packaging

## Branch Management
- main/master: Main branch, keep in stable and releasable state
- develop: Development branch, contains the latest development features
- feature/*: Feature branches, used for developing new features
- bugfix/*: Fix branches, used for fixing bugs
- release/*: Release branches, used for preparing releases

## Important Principles
**Important**: Do not automatically commit git code unless explicitly instructed
Ensure code passes all tests before committing
Keep commit messages concise and clear, describing the changes accurately
Avoid large commits, try to break changes into small, related commits
